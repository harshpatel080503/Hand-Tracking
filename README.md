# Hand Tracking with OpenCV and MediaPipe
## Project Overview
This project implements real-time hand tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe. It captures video input from the webcam, processes each frame to detect hand landmarks, and overlays hand connections and landmark points on the video feed. The frame rate (FPS) is also displayed in real-time. The project can be extended for gesture recognition, sign language interpretation, or other hand-based interaction applications.
## Key Features
1.Real-time hand tracking using a webcam feed.\n
2.Detection and visualization of hand landmarks (e.g., fingertips, knuckles).
3.Calculation and display of frames per second (FPS) for performance tracking.
4.Easy-to-extend code for gesture recognition and further hand interaction applications.
